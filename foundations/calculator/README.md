# TOP | Calculator

Noteable change from instructions:

-   After an operator is selected, the first operand and that operator are displayed on a different line.
-   When a result is displayed, pressing a new digit does not start a new calculation, but continues the equation. (may adjust in future)

Known Bugs:

-   If an answer to an equation is 0, adding an operand 0 < n < 1 such as 0.1, then selecting an operator, the previous value will change back to 0.

Future Adjustments:

-   Replace Odin Button with % functionality.
-   Add keyboard accessibility.
-   Add more operators such as exponents, factorials, square roots, logs, etc.
